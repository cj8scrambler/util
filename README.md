# Util
Collection of utilities and scripts that I use

## [teams-busylight](teams-busylight)
Python script to update my teams status based on command line activity
and send status to a busylight

## [git-hooks](git-hooks)
Git hooks script which add a warning when pushing to a 'protected' branch.
Helpful when your account has elevated push privileges for merge work, but
you don't trust yourself to not accidently break things.
